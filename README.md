# Makefile-C-Python

# Description
A Makefile for a C + Python + numpy project. 

# Motivation
Mostly so you can seamlessly use gcc/icc/clang with OpenMP and have all reasonable options set automatically. The only file in the this repo, ``common.mk`` is taken directly from a different project of mine : [Corrfunc](github.com/manodeep/Corrfunc/).
